# PX915 - Control of Thin Liquid Films

Code for modelling thin liquid films controlled by baseplate actuators. Written for the PX915 individual project by [Oscar Holroyd](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/people/studentscohort3/holroyd/), supervised by [Radu Cimpeanu](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/cimpeanu/) and [Susana Gomes](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/gomes).


## Installation
* The code relies on [Basilisk](<http://basilisk.fr/>) to model the Navier-Stokes equations. See the [installation page](<http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL>) for instructions. Note that bview is *not* required.
* The LQR controls require a functioning [LAPACKE](https://netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html) implementation.

Once these are installed, an executable can be generated:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OaHolroyd/px915-basilisk
cd px915-basilisk
make source
make
```
